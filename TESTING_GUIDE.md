- Username shown on screen
- Status shows "‚è≥ Waiting"
- "Start Game Now" button visible

---

### Test 2: Multi-Player Registration ‚úÖ

**Steps:**

---

### Test 3: Time Synchronization ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. With 2+ players registered

3. Watch all tabs simultaneously

**Expected Result:**
- **All tabs show identical countdown**: 3... 2... 1...
- Countdown appears at the SAME TIME in all tabs
- Game starts simultaneously for all players
- Timer counts down identically in all tabs

**What This Proves:** UTC timestamps + PubSub ensure fair, synchronized start

---

### Test 4: Real-Time Tap Counting ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. During "PLAYING" phase
2. Click "TAP!" button rapidly in Tab 1
3. Click "TAP!" button slowly in Tab 2
4. Don't click in Tab 3

**Expected Result:**
- Each tab shows its own tap count
- All tabs see ALL players' tap counts update in real-time
- Tap counts are accurate (one tap = one count)
- Leaderboard order updates automatically (highest first)

---

### Test 5: Game End & Winner Announcement ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. Wait for 15-second timer to reach 0
2. Observe all tabs

**Expected Result:**
- All tabs show "üèÜ Game Over! üèÜ" at the same time
- Winner is displayed (player with most taps)
- Final scores shown to all players
- Same winner in ALL tabs

---

### Test 6: Leaderboard Persistence ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. Complete a game
2. Note the top score
3. Refresh the browser (F5)
4. Re-join with same username
5. Check "All-Time Leaderboard"

**Expected Result:**
- Leaderboard shows previous scores
- Top score is still there after refresh
- Scores are sorted (highest to lowest)
- Usernames are displayed correctly

---

### Test 7: Database Verification üóÑÔ∏è

**Steps:**
1. Open PostgreSQL client or run:
   ```cmd
   cd d:\bassant\Freelancing\task3\tap_game
   mix ecto.psql
   ```
2. Query users:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users;
   ```
3. Query game sessions:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM game_sessions ORDER BY tap_count DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

**Expected Result:**
- Users table contains all registered players
- Game sessions table has records for each game
- Timestamps are in UTC format
- Tap counts match what was displayed

---

### Test 8: Fairness Test (No Cheating) üõ°Ô∏è

**Attempt to Cheat:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console
3. Try to manually fire tap events:
   ```javascript
   // Try to cheat by firing multiple events
   for(let i=0; i<1000; i++) {
     document.querySelector('[phx-click="tap"]').click();
   }
   ```

**Expected Result:**
- Server validates each tap
- `phx-throttle="50"` limits tap frequency
- Impossible to get unrealistic scores
- Server controls game state (can't tap when not playing)

---

### Test 9: Timezone Independence üåç

**Simulate Different Timezones:**

**Option A - Change System Time:**
1. Complete a game
2. Change Windows timezone to different region
3. Play another game

**Option B - Check Timestamps:**
1. After playing, check database:
   ```sql
   SELECT game_started_at, game_ended_at FROM game_sessions;
   ```
2. Verify timestamps are in UTC (not local time)

**Expected Result:**
- Game works identically regardless of local timezone
- All timestamps stored in UTC
- Game duration is exactly 15 seconds for everyone

---

### Test 10: Reconnection & State Recovery üîÑ

**Steps:**
1. Start a game with Player1
2. During countdown, close Tab 1
3. Immediately reopen and rejoin as Player1
4. Game should continue

**Expected Result:**
- New session can be created
- Game state is managed server-side
- No disruption to other players

---

### Test 11: Edge Cases üîç

**Test A: Empty Username**
- Try to join with empty username
- Should show error

**Test B: Duplicate Username**
- Register as "Player1" in Tab 1
- Try to register as "Player1" in Tab 2
- Should succeed (gets existing user)

**Test C: Long Username**
- Try username with 51+ characters
- Should show error (max 50)

**Test D: Rapid Tapping**
- Click TAP button as fast as possible
- Count should increment smoothly
- No missed taps (within throttle limit)

---

## Performance Tests

### Test 12: Many Simultaneous Players üë•

**Steps:**
1. Open 10+ browser tabs
2. Register unique username in each
3. Start game
4. All players tap simultaneously

**Expected Result:**
- System handles all players smoothly
- No lag or delays
- All tap counts update correctly
- No server crashes
