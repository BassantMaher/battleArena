```

### After (Session-Based)
```
SessionManager → GameSession #1 → Players 1-3
              → GameSession #2 → Players 4-6
              → GameSession #3 → Players 7-9
```

## Key Features

### Session Management

- ✅ **Max capacity**: 10 players per session
- ✅ **Auto-cleanup**: Empty sessions are removed

### Safety Checks
- ✅ **No empty games**: Cannot start games with 0 players
- ✅ **Disconnect handling**: Players removed on disconnect
- ✅ **Reset on empty**: Game resets if all players leave
- ✅ **UI disabled**: Start button disabled when no players

### User Experience
